# Infection Chain Backend

This is the backend component of the Project Infection Chain (https://devpost.com/software/infection-chain).
The backend has been developed using Spring Boot and Java 11.

# Functionality

- User-Registration
- User-Authentication
- QR-Code generation for users to scan each other
- When users scan each other, the geolocation of this scan will be persisted
- Users can set their health status to 'infected'
- Users can retrieve locations, which infected users got close to and thereby know, if they may have been infected as well
